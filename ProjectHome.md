The Terrain Toolkit project was created by Sándor Moldán as part of the Unity Summer of Code 2009.

The objective of the project was to develop a toolset for the Unity Editor which would streamline and improve the workflow involved in creating terrains for games.

The result is the Terrain Toolkit component - an integrated solution for terrain generation in the Unity game engine.
